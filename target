##### Terraform target command applications #####

1. a plain terraform destroy command winds up your entire infrastructure declared in the tf file.
What if you only want to terminate the EC2 instance and leave the other VPC components intact?
The method is to use the terraform target command with -target option as illustrated below.

a. find the name of the resource that needs to be destroyed.

$ terraform state list

PS C:\Users\hamid\repos\terraform\project-1> terraform state list
aws_eip.tf-ip
aws_instance.web-server
aws_internet_gateway.tf-web-igw
aws_network_interface.web-tf-if
aws_route_table.tf-web-rt
aws_route_table_association.web-subnet-tf
aws_security_group.web-tf-sg
aws_subnet.internet-facing
aws_vpc.terraform-tut

b. terraform destroy -target aws_instance.web-server
  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.web-server: Destroying... [id=i-02fc1082bfb019aba]
aws_instance.web-server: Still destroying... [id=i-02fc1082bfb019aba, 10s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still destroying... [id=i-02fc1082bfb019aba, 20s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still destroying... [id=i-02fc1082bfb019aba, 30s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still destroying... [id=i-02fc1082bfb019aba, 40s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Destruction complete after 41s

2. To deploy a particular resource

$ terraform -targt aws_instance.web-server apply

aws_instance.web-server: Creating...
aws_instance.web-server: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Still creating... [50s elapsed]
aws_instance.web-server: Creation complete after 54s [id=i-0cb17498e4390f753]
